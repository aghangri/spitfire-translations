# Translations
- This repository is created to add and improve multiple language support of the [Rookie Spitfire Bot](https://rookie-spitfire.cf)
- Use [CROWDIN](https://crowdin.com/project/rookie-spitfire) to translate bot's messages. This repository only contains command names and descriptions.
- You can add/edit any language you want to improve, fix the existing languages.
- Do **NOT** change "name". For example, { "name": "help", "localizedName": "help", "localizedDescription": "Get help" } you must change localizedName and localizedDescription here, not "name".
- Create a pull request, say what you changed and I will look into it. You can also add your Discord username to description to get a role in the [support server](https://discord.gg/HzRw297nRR)
